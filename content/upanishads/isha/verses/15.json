    "notes": "This verse marks a major transition in the Upaniṣad. Śaṅkara Bhagavadpāda's introduction establishes that the teaching up to prakṛti-laya represents the extent of saṃsāra and worldly attainments. Beyond this begins the supreme teaching of Self-knowledge (sarvātma-bhāva) for renunciates. The commentary then divides all Vedic teaching into pravṛtti-lakṣaṇa (characterized by engagement in duties) and nivṛtti-lakṣaṇa (characterized by withdrawal/renunciation). This verse is the prayer of a qualified seeker who has performed prescribed karmas with upāsanā throughout life. At death, recognizing the limitation of relative attainments, such a person prays to the Sun deity (Pūṣan) to remove the luminous disc covering the face of supreme Truth (Brahman in the solar orb), seeking direct vision of the Self. This begins the section on supreme Self-knowledge for those ready for liberation."
