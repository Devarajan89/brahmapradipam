      "Those who worship karma alone (without vidyā) enter blind darkness",

      "This condemns exclusive practice (ekaikānuṣṭhāna) of either, not the practices themselves",
      "The condemnation is due to the desire for combination (samuccicīṣā) - doing both together",
      "Neither karma nor deity-knowledge should be practiced exclusively",

    "notes": "Śaṅkara Bhagavadpāda's commentary establishes that avidyā here specifically means karma (rituals like agnihotra), not metaphysical ignorance, while vidyā means upāsanā (deity-meditation) leading to deva-loka, not supreme Brahman-knowledge. The condemnation is not of these practices themselves - both are śāstra-vihita (scripture-enjoined) with their own legitimate fruits (pitṛ-loka for karma, deva-loka for vidyā per Bṛ.Up. 1.5.16). Rather, what is condemned is exclusive practice (ekaikānuṣṭhāna) of either one alone.\n\nThe verse teaches that those who practice karma exclusively without vidyā enter blind darkness, while those who abandon karma and practice only vidyā enter even greater darkness. This establishes the foundation for the samuccaya teaching in subsequent mantras - that karma and vidyā should be combined appropriately. This teaching is specifically for householders who still have desires (kāmin), not for the desireless renunciates (akāmin) established in Self-knowledge for whom such combination is impossible and unnecessary."

  "centralTeaching": "Exclusive devotion to either karma (rituals) alone or upāsanā (deity-meditation) alone leads to darkness.
