      "Vidyā produces a different result than avidyā (karma)",
      "As stated in Bṛhadāraṇyaka: 'By karma, pitṛ-loka; by vidyā, deva-loka'",
      "This teaching comes from the wise (dhīra), meaning teachers",
      "It is received through paramparā (traditional lineage)",
      "The ācāryas have explained both karma and jñāna to us",
      "This establishes the separate fruits of vidyā and avidyā, justifying their combination",
      "The different results prove neither should be abandoned"
    ],
    "notes": "This mantra establishes that vidyā (deity-knowledge/upāsanā) and avidyā (karma) produce different results, which is the basis for their combination. Śaṅkara Bhagavadpāda cites Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.5.16 as scriptural authority: karma leads to pitṛ-loka (world of ancestors), while vidyā leads to deva-loka (world of gods). The mantra emphasizes that this is traditional knowledge received from wise teachers through paramparā, not a new teaching. Since both have distinct, valid fruits mentioned in śruti, both should be practiced together by qualified householders, not abandoned."

  "centralTeaching": "Vidyā (knowledge of deities) and avidyā (karma/rituals) produce different results according to the wise teachers of the tradition. This difference in fruits is the reason why both should be combined, not practiced exclusively - each leads to its own valid goal as per the śāstras.",
