    ],
    "notes": "This mantra is the culmination of mantras 5 and 6, emphasizing the complete freedom from all suffering that comes from Self-knowledge. Śaṅkara Bhagavadpāda's commentary is particularly significant here: by rhetorically asking 'what delusion? what sorrow?' (ko mohaḥ kaḥ śokaḥ), the mantra negates not just these two but their entire causal chain. Since moha and śoka are effects of avidyā and are themselves the seeds (bīja) of desire and action, their impossibility means the total destruction (atyantam eva ucchedaḥ) of saṃsāra with all its causes. The comparison to space (gaganopama) emphasizes the Self's pure, undivided, all-pervading nature."

  "centralTeaching": "For the one who has realized the oneness of the Self - seeing all beings as the Self alone - there can be no delusion or sorrow whatsoever. Since moha and śoka are products of ignorance and are themselves the seeds of desire and karma, their impossibility in Self-knowledge demonstrates the complete and permanent cessation of saṃsāra along with its entire causal chain.",
